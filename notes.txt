current status of this proj is that the blank model can infact be created
although this is able to predict, its very basic and also have lots of errors

I have a few backend TODOs to keep in mind

TODO: sampling : increase the amount of items to be sampled
    will help with accuracy (will increase training time but should be fine)

TODO: entity creation : 
    add more items to the template
    create a dev-train.json
        consists of a validation set which is unseen data

TODO: spacyFile creation: 
    create a dev-train.spacy with the json
    try using an existing model when creating the .spacy
        if not look into adding the trained food model to the existing model

TODO: CLI spacy train: when doing final train, 
    in config.cfg increase training.patience and max_steps

TODO: use the openAI whisper 
    use the obtained text with the model in NER.py

TODO: create the frontend UI and work on relevant Flask files
