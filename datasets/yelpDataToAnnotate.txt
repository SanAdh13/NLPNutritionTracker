Okay I must say that I'm biased when I make reviews because they're usually places I like enough to review or absolutely terrible that I can't stand the service or something about the operation... If you like Indian I mean if you love Indian this is the best place to go in northeastern Ohio near Akron to Cleveland.---We loved the food, the atmosphere, and the warm friendly service. This took me back to my Hungarian roots. Just loved being there!---The best Italian restaurant in the city. I've tried just about everything and the consistency and quality of the preparation is outstanding. It doesn't look like much from the street but once inside the professional staff will take great care of you. The space is intimate and calm. Even though the staff are working hard they are efficient and don't appear rushed or flustered. They are obviously well trained. The selection of wine is very good, the menu is diverse, and we have never had a negative word to say. We love it, and Ghenty in the kitchen is a master.---Had dinner here on a Saturday night. Arrived between 5:30-6:00, and the place was getting busy. There was a line stretching outside, and I'm guessing the wait time for an inside table was around 20-30 minutes. We decided to take an outdoor table, and although it was a touch warm, it was the perfect environment for a BBQ feast. Draft beer selection is pretty minimal, but the waitress said they had a larger selection of bottled beers. Apps - got a couple orders of wings and some burnt ends for our large party. The wings were large and quite tasty, and basically the wing version of their fried chicken dinner (more about that later). The burnt ends were good, but they came covered in their BBQ sauce, and the flavor overpowered the meat. Would prefer to have the sauce just on the side...will remember that for next time. Dinner - the four adults in our party each ordered something different so we could share. The brisket was tender, and I imagine their sandwiches are killer. The pulled pork was pretty good, but the portion size (compared to the other meals) was on the smaller side. Again, bet it would make a great sandwich. I had the full rack of baby rack ribs, and they were solid. Meat fell off of the bone, and it was clear these babies were smoked on premises...hell, we sat next to the smokers! Maybe just a touch on the dry side, though. My wife ordered the whole friend chicken. It came out on two plates! It could literally feed an entire family easily. The batter is light and on the mild side, and the chicken was very meaty. However, and this is common with large pieces of fried meat, it was on the dry side because they had to cook it for so long. That said, it was an impressive meal. My only other nitpick is that the portion of the side dishes I ordered were very small. While the mac & cheese and southern-style green beans were very good, they were gone in a couple of bites. Oh well. The reason that this isn't a five-star review is because of the service. Our server was very friendly, and handled our large party (4 adults, 5 kids) very well, but she completely forgot our second round of drinks (draft beer and a glass of wine). Normally, this wouldn't be a problem, but since the place was busy, it took about 30 minutes for our food to leave the kitchen. We didn't see her for about 20 minutes after placing the order, so I went inside and had another server take care of it for me. Only flaw in what was otherwise and highly enjoyable meal. We will certainly be back!---This was my first visit to a Cheesecake Factory anywhere in the US. I really wasn't expecting the opulence of the interior, so my senses were a little overwhelmed. I got there about 10 minutes before they opened, so as I sat in the car waiting I got to watch the throng of staff as they filtered in. I've never seen that large a number of staff at a restaurant in my entire life. As many have said, the menu is way too extensive and the pages of advertising are off-putting. I was greeted almost immediately by a lead waiter and a young man that he was training. Both were very attentive. They both did something I personally find a little annoying, which was to say something like "excellent choice" upon my selection of items. My self-esteem is fine, I really don't need my ego massaged. I ordered the lunch pepperoni pizza with side salad, and both were good. I followed that with the Dulce de Leche Caramel Cheesecake, and it would be worth the 52-mile round trip just to have that again. The cost for the lunch, including a 20% tip, was $27. As a retired teacher, I find that very pricey, but it was still a good experience. I'd definitely reserve this for only special occasions due to the price.---Amazing South Indian food. We had idli, paper masala dosa and rava masala dosa. Great chatni and sambar!---Absolutely Fantastic Brunch!! Came here this morning with a friend for brunch and loved it!! Great atmosphere, we sat outside on the patio to get away from the crowd inside and enjoyed the sunshine! My friend got the quiche special which was bacon and avocado and came with tomato soup and potatoes. I got the bacon and avocado croissant sandwich which was divine!! The bacon at this restaurant is phenomenal and so thick and tasty! I loved it here and will definitely come back for more tasty treats!!---We went there with family for a Saturday night dinner. It was extremely crowded which was a good sign of a excellent meal to come. We ordered an appetizer of hummus and also an appetizer of boneless wings with a honey Golden glaze. Both were delicious and very hot in temperature. The waitress recommended some seasonal beers which all were very delightful. It took a while to get the hamburgers but it was well worth the wait. They were stacked high with toppings cooked to perfection and hot to the last bite. We will be back!---Had a very positive experience here. Just came for drinks, but everything was reasonably priced (especially in comparison to the bars surrounding it). Our bartender was friendly and knowledgeable and stopped by our table every five minutes or so to check on us. I would definitely recommend it.---Good sushi. Tried the bourbon chicken, and general tsos and it was not the best I've ever had, but still good.---Try this place!! We went on a weekday for lunch the day after we got back from a boozy vacay.... needless to say that this was the perfect way to ease back into the real world! The food was amazing and it was so hard to choose from all the options on the menu. I had the Fried Chicken Sausage & my boyfriend had the polish boy, we split the banter disco poutine. Sorry, I ate it so fast that I didn't snap any pics :) Just take my word for it and try it!---We had a great dinner here before a game one night. Joseph was our server and he was probably one of the best servers we have ever had in Cleveland. He was informative about the menu without being overwhelming. He helped us decide on our menu choices since it was our first time and everything sounded delicious. We had the pirogies, flank steak, and the peppercorn crusted steak ( can't remember the cut ), fries and the Brussels sprouts. Everything was delicious and too notch. We both had drinks from the bar which we enjoyed! We had the s'mores dessert which was delicious!!!!!! We will 100% go back. They have a great staff, atmosphere and menu! If you haven't been I would put it on your list, it will not disappoint!! ( my drink was a grapefruit drink - amazing !! )---Very impressed!!! They were willing to make items from scratch for me to accommodate difficult allergies to onions and carrots! It was all amazing! Will definitely eat here over and over again! Only complaint was slow service from waitress and lack of cheese naan :)---Great sliders, the chicken bacon ranch is amazing!! Pizza is pretty good, red sauce is okay. Have only been there for lunch but definitely been good every time I have been there. The staff is friendly and the food comes out quickly!---Just like canes, fresh, delicious and chicken fried goodness. And I beat Kevin at tic tac toe on the chalkboard. BooYAAA---Wilbert's is awesome. I usually go here to pregame before Cleveland sporting events. On Friday's they host live bands, which is pretty cool. The drinks are super cheap and the bartenders are very sweet.---As fast food goes the quality is good, freshly made, and staff is friendly. Service can be slow and checking out at the counter can take a ridiculously long time. The place is always busy and open 24 hours. It's also inexpensive.---Less than a half hour's drive from the Beer Engine is the Brew Kettle Taproom & Smokehouse, located in a suburb outside Cleveland. Beer nuts flock here for brewer Chris McKim's singular concoctions, which he sells under the Ringneck Brewing label. Sample the sobriety-crushing Old 21 IPA, clocking in at 9% alcohol, or dial it back with a quality session beer like Victory's Prima Pils. All in all, some two dozen varieties are on tap for tasting. For those who'd rather brew their own, the attached brew-on-premises provides all the equipment, ingredients and know-how to craft an award-winner of one's own.---Did someone say fried poached egg atop corned beef hash. I mean what more could a girl ask for. I know, some of the best creme brûlée around Cleveland. Im not gonna lie everything wasn't perfect I will admit the cheesecake had a very weird consistency it was almost like a ball of heavy glue. Other than that little bump in the road this place is magically delicious---One word: AMAZING!!! My boyfriend had been talking about this place for months now after eating lunch here and I have been dying to try it ever since! Well, that finally happened this weekend when we were out roaming downtown for apartments, and it was everything I had imagined - and more! The spot is small - VERY small, but cozy. We walked in and were seated immediately and placed our orders within minutes. I had the #3 ( Ph tái chín), which was noodles with brisket and eye-round and the bf had the #12 (Ph dc biêt), which had every meat possible. We ordered and before I knew it, minutes later we had our food - talk about service. The dish that comes out is very simple - noodles, broth, your meat and some herbs. They bring out a dish with more leafy herbs (I didn't try any so I have no idea what they are), bean sprouts, and jalapenos. There are also different sauces you can add to make the broth however hot and/or sweet you want it, but I suggest not adding too much to take away from the flavor of the dish. I highly recommend this place - it's comfort Asian food at its best. And don't wait to check it out - you'll kick yourself for it (I did!)---Fish chowder is one of the best. Made of real fish not msg. Ramen noodle salad is my second favorite. Probably the only place in Cleveland for real Burmese food and authentic Asian cuisine.---I love this place. It's the old "Phoenix" in a new, larger location. The staff is still amazing and it's a great atmosphere. One of the coolest things about it is how someone painted portraits of some of the most loyal customers in the bathrooms...I know that might sound weird to some people, but I think it's awesome. See Brandon I.'s review for a great description.---This is our second time here within a couple of weeks and the food has yet to disappoint us. The atmosphere and service are really good. I like the fact that it's not that popular here yet and I get to enjoy the whole ambience of the riverfront deck. Please come and visit this place.---I've gone back 4 times in one week. I think I'm a bahn-mi-holic. SO yummy. My bf asks everyday to go back, and I just have to say no because it's so bad for our waistline as we eat 2 sandwiches each time. Have to stave off until next week. It's ridiculous.---Liked the variety of toppings, especially the sport peppers and Chicago style relish. The arugula wasn't so fresh but their other toppings such as the lettuce and cucumbers were. I asked for a medium-done burger, although I suppose I should have said medium-rare because the burger was a bit on the well done side. However, I do prefer the simplistic burger style with a bunch of toppings that I cannot always get at other burger joints such as Five Guys. I also prefer these fries over Five Guys since Five Guys fries taste a bit chewy to me (due to their thicker size). The fries are cheaper, making our overall meal slightly under the price we pay at Five Guys. So although the burger itself was decent - the toppings are what may draw you here in general. FYI - no A1, fresh jalapenos (just pickled), or curly fries. And a shout out to the guy who made my burger who didn't shy away from all the toppings I piled on!---Saloon isn't quite the right word or description for this place. Great atmosphere in the old civil war brick building. Good service. And the Bison burger was delicious.---Best football (soccer) pub in Cleveland! Arsenal fans not welcome, great people and food.---I am from California and each time I come to Ohio to visit family and friends, we HAVE to make a stop at Yuzu!! The vibe is so great and the food is amazing!! We love the extensive beer options and unique descriptions, they always make me laugh out loud :) The service is always above and beyond and the food is affordable and never disappoints! The rice bowls are my favorite! I love sitting on the patio and especially love that it is dog friendly and our pups have their own menu! Dog Beer? Yes!! :) If you are ever in the Lakewood area, make sure to try this awesome new spot, you will not be disappointed!---Great food. Lisa is the best hostess ever!Drove 6 hours to get there. Food, service, awesome. Would go back again just because of the wonderful hostess! Location is easy to find. Prices are a bargain.---FINALLY!!! A legit barbecue spot in The Cleveland area...Parma no less! Pulled pork is amazing, melt in your mouth delicious. Brisket was also really tasty. Buns are locally made at On the Rise bakery on the Eastside. Side dishes we tried were also very good! Smoked potato salad...two thumbs up! Mac n Cheese is homemade with a nice creamy béchamel sauce made with parmesan & cheddar. They also have something called cupcake chicken...we didn't try it this time, but considering how awesome everything we had was...we will most definitely give that a try next time! I'd post a picture, but we ate it all too quickly to do that! Check them out!!---Good food for delivery at 1:30 am. Was happy to find a place that offered more than just pizza at the late hour. Food was delivered fast and hot.---P.J.'s is arguably the best-looking, most dignified establishment of the Kamm's Corners bar scene, but that's not to say that it doesn't get just as rowdy as some of the other bars. By day, it's family friendly and offers a menu that goes a step beyond standard bar food with substantial entrees and unconventional appetizers (offerings like Irish egg rolls set the tone for this Irish-themed and Irish-frequented place). I've had their wings and bruschetta, among other things, and have felt like their portions are generous and their ingredients fresh. In terms of nightlife, live bands often grace the stage, back by the wall of stained glass set in dark wood that I have always suspected is there to bring about memories of church and rouse Catholic guilt, whether you were raised in the Catholic church or not. It's loud and usually crowded on the weekends and can even get pretty lively during a weekday evening. Once, when I was getting a beer after work, I marveled at the completely wasted gaggle of twentysomethings who were trying to take bar pictures for Facebook--you know, at six p.m. on a Wednesday. That being said, I still enjoy P.J.'s, and just consider it to be a very West Park kind of bar, meaning it's pretty homogeneous in a white middle class kind of way. You can watch sports and bond over alumni connections from local schools and dance in the back, and it is what it is. The age demographic is mixed, however; I've seen argyle-clad women in their seventies dancing until last call before, and it's not unheard of for someone fresh out of college to be at the bar with their friends while their parents are socializing in another area. I just wish the beer selection was larger and more varied--for a bar of its size, the tap choices can be relatively generic and redundant, compared to other bars that offer a wider range of microbrews and seasonals.---Excellent location for a Friday night date or family dinner night out. Duane was an amazing waiter - 5 star customer service.---To the folks who say "you shouldn't have to wait 2 hours for a grilled cheese" - I say: DON'T! Please, I'm begging you, if you think you can whip up a grilled cheese sandwich at home of similar or better caliber, be my guest. I've tried with all my might to clone Melt at home; I've come close on some sandwiches, but it's not as easy as you'd think. Look people, most of us grew up toasting two slices of bread with some American cheese in the middle. The fact Melt serves something that's also called "grilled cheese" does not mean it's the same thing. Get this out of your brain. Here's something a lot of reviewers don't seem to know/understand: Melt (the original one in Lakewood) started as a bar - the fact that the sandwiches became such a hit was a nice surprise. BUT, the thing that Melt is really awesome at is being a bar! Do you like beer? Just look at their craft beer list. Few bars in town are going to have a list that good, and at decent prices to boot.---Food was good but the heads staring at me was unappetizing. Nice decor otherwise. Just get rid of the taxidermy in at least one area of the restaurant.---While the name implies that this place is all about soup, I am in it for the salads! PROS ~~The Caesar Salad~~ I have gone to countless other places and order the Caesar and I have yet to find one the compares to the Souper Market's glorious version of it. Thick, crunchy, flavorful croutons. Homemade dressing. Bacon (because it makes everything better). And I always order it with an extra slice of fresh bread (I think it's from Stone Oven Bakery). ~~Delicious soups~~ While I am obsessed with the salad, when the weather starts to cool down, Souper Market is usually my first choice for a nice, warm-me-up lunch. I have yet to try a soup I didn't like, but my favorite is the Creamy Wild Mushroom Soup. ~~Selection of soups and salads...and samples!~~ Good luck narrowing down your lunch choice; it will be hard to pick just one! They have both seasonal and weekly specials. And if you are just not sure what you'd like, just ask for a sample so you can try before you buy. ~~Now open Sundays!!!~~ I recently walked by on a Sunday afternoon and was surprised to see that my fav lunch spot was open. So of course I walked in and got a Caesar salad!. CONS ~~Seating~~ If you were planning on bringing a posse of more than 2 people, you will need to order to-go. Luckily, there are plenty of picnicky places near by that would be perfect for an afternoon outing. ~~Hours~~ While I am ecstatic that they are now open on Sundays, I have a hard time getting to this location before they close at 7p on weeknights. More my problem than theirs--I think most people eat dinner before then! BOTTOM LINE ~~Souper Market has SUPER salad and soups and serves the best Caesar Salad in the greater Cleveland area.~~---WOW the best pizza I've ever hadfriends have told me about it and kinda blew it off ....however went today for lunch got there as soon as they opened (typically when any place first opens the doors there not ready to go)Samoskys on the other hand was ready all the girls were friendly helpful and well prepared to start there daywe've been in the business for years not easy to please we're sometimes picky nothing to complain about all great---Pricey but delicious and worth every penny ! If you want REAL amazing delectable Italian food, you have to go here. The salad with the strawberry vinaigrette dressing, strawberries and caramelized pecans is my favorite.you also must try. A home made cannoli ! I have had them cater to a number of family events as well!---Went for lunch. Service was great and the food was excellent. The soup portion was quite large but the entrees for lunch were perfect size. I had the hanger steak and frites. Cooked perfect. I will go back for dinner. Nice quaint place. Nice wine and beer selection as well.---Wow. If I could end this review here it would some this entire place up. From the valet down to the waiter, everything was perfect. The food we ordered came out perfect. Everything was seasoned and cooked to perfection. I couldn't have asked for better our waiter was spot on with his customer service. It seemed like he may have owned shares of the company with how he took care of our table. We will definitely return and I hope to see some of you guys there too. You won't regret. And the views are to die for.---I give Lemon falls 4.5 Stars for food & customer service but why doesn't the website tell when they open & close?! I'm a village resident within walking distance just wanting to know when they open Saturday morning while walking my dog, he loves their homemade dog biscuits. Please update your site!---Meredith is an amazing bartender & person!! She was attentive to me & my group in a FULL bar on a Friday night. Will definitely come back anytime I'm in Solon. Thanks Meredith---Wonderful food. Unlike anything I ever tasted, but delicious, no matter what I order off the menu, it's good. Prices are reasonable too.---What can I say that hasn't already been mentioned? The vanilla bean milk shake with apple pie, bacon and bourbon was amazingly good. The burgers were cooked perfectly. The onion rings were delicious if a touch too greasy. The pickle bar was great. Didn't love the "no courses" thing, but the food was fast, fresh and well made. If only there was one closer to home.---Everything is excellent here. The chef is very inventive with his pairings and we really enjoy eating here. Plates are always well-sized and the hardest part is limiting your choices down to only a few each time - ha! We could eat the duck wings for days. I'd like to see the brunch menu offered occasionally on other days than Sunday. Hands down the best food we have had in Medina.---My husband and I had our anniversary dinner here. First time diners there I didn't know what to expect. Their steaks were amazing, you almost don't need a steak knife. The interior of the restaurant is a little more plain than I expected but it's still very nice.---Attended The Wedding Walk this weekend that started at the Brewing Company. Obviously it wasn't its typical scene, but I have been there so many times, I can still give an overall review. I love their 2 patios, and because the weather was so nice, we were able to take great advantage of these today. It was even better because it wasn't as crowded as usual, so we could sit down and enjoy some of the great appetizers provided by the restaurant. I loved the spinach and artichoke dip and chips, as well as some of the other passed apps. Other times I have eaten here, I have ordered the French Onion soup, the hot pretzels, the chicken salad and the chocolate peanut butter dessert. The onion soup is always good (ask for the cheese well done!), the pretzels come with several sauces - they are also part of the appetizer sampler, which is a great idea if you want a bit of everything. The salads are HUGE!! And although I am not a dessert person, the fresh whipped cream stole me heart. For my visit yesterday, I got to see some rooms I didn't know existed and walk around freely. And, luckily for me, I didn't get peed on by the guy who got arrested there over the weekend (read it on Cleveland.com!)---So excited to have this place close to home. My wife visited India in college and she got me hooked on Indian food, and this is the first time I've had authentic Indian flavor in a fast casual setting. The Chipotle-style Indian food concept is awesomely done here. I had the chicken tikka masala bowl and added the tamarind date chutney, and the flavors really popped. Also tried some sides and chai tea, and it was all quite good. Also, props to them for letting customers choose the spice level they want - I enjoy Indian flavors and a little spice, but I wouldn't enjoy authentic Indian (read: extreme) spiciness, so this was perfect. If I wanted it though, I could have had it. We'll definitely be back for more tikka masala rice bowls! Hope this place sticks around for a long time.---If you like hot dogs you MUST go to Happy Dog. I suggest you go hungry. The dogs are the best and the toppings are over the top (pun intended). Seriously, you must try it. They only do hot dogs and they do them extremely well. Great service, yummy food, casual atmosphere and later in the evening all types of live music. This is a go to spot for me, once you try it, it will be for you too.---Well this was my first time here as a yelper,also for lunch nice and quiet. Waitress was nice and helpful. The food amazing as usual, we got the breadsticks and a small deluxe special ordered cause of differences on green peppers and mushrooms. They were very accommodating on the part of halfing the toppings. Very good and enjoyable experience.---
