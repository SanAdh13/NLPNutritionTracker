We got the fruit lovers custard crepe for dessert! I love custard anything!! They use fresh ingredients and make the crepes right in front of you!! It was a quick in and out. Next time I would like to try a savory crepe and have brunch here. Not only do they have sweet and savory crepes they also have waffles and Hershey's ice cream too! I recommend this place for brunch or even an after dinner dessert stop. The shop is adorable! I would say a French inspired decor.---Oh, this place is very hip, delicious and awesome!!! Seriously, we've gone here three times in the past four weeks already. The location is not the best - it's sort of right on the edge of Ohio City and the not-to-good neighborhood just east of Ohio City. But the food options - they are very inventive and taste amazing. We love the graham cracker waffle; it also has chocolate and marshmallows which make it essentially a s'more in waffle form. The breakfast banh mi is also my go-to dish now, it's a twist on a banh mi with eggs and sausage instead. They have rotating items on the menu which have been very creative and haven't failed us yet - I've tried the clam bake benedict, a pulled pork waffle and lox breakfast salad, all of which were terrific. They have "happy hour" every day (Saturday included) from 1-3 pm when you can get all of their waffles and pancakes for $5 each.---My sister held her graduation party here, on a Saturday afternoon, and things could not have been more perfect. The salads were fresh, and made with absolute quality ingredients, and portions were quite generous! I ordered the Whole Wheat Penne Sorrento, and was very impressed with the vegetables, pasta, and freshness of the dish. The staff was fantastic, and everyone was very happy.---This was a wonderful experience, the staff was great and the pizza was one of the best I have had in a long time. The only down side was the gelato machine was down, but this is not terrible as it means I will need to go back again for the full experience.---Ask for Michele!! She was so kind and accommodating. Our meal was fantastic from appetizer to dessert! The "Happy Birthday Cannoli"was a special surprise!! We had a terrific dining experience!---Very cool area to go out in Cleveland, and lots of great eating options to choose from, but If you are looking for quality food- flying fig is the place to be. Yes, you will be paying for it because the food is expensive, but high quality. Nice for a special occasion. As a vegetarian, I especially appreciated a diverse set of veggie options, and a generous wine list. My husband and dad meat-eaters also enjoyed their meat options. Menu is somewhat limited due to boutique nature of the restaurant, so if you are into substitution or customization of your food, this is probably not a place you would want to eat. We ate on the front patio so enjoyed people watching and a nice Cleveland summer afternoon! Pretty easy walk to Indians baseball game afterward (if you don't mind crossing that huge bridge).---Great beer selection, love the bar itself, good food (liked the guacamole and the ribs)!---I tried the gyro quesadilla and was blown away. Not only is the food good but the customer service is excellent. Thanks guys for the great service and excellent food I will be seeing you guys real soon.---I came here yesterday while in town on business and was super impressed. I had a big salad and a small hummus with chicken and had to take most of it home- the portions are HUGE! It was absolutely delicious. I haven't had hummus this tasty since being in Israel- highly, highly recommended!!---What a pleasant surprise. Went there on a rainy Saturday afternoon in September and got a nice table right by the windows where we could people watch. It was one of our Saturday lunches out without the kids. Both my wife and I were pleasantly surprised by this establishment. Very nice decor, clean, good attentive service, excellent food and decent prices. Started off with the Summer rolls (2) with House Special Sauce which is basically Hoison Sauce with crushed peanuts in it. Very fresh, very nicely presented on a square white plate, and very delicious. you could tell it was just hand rolled seconds before we got it. My wife tried the Vegetable spring roll, which were deep fried and served with sweet and sour sauce. Also very good, but I preferred the fresh summer roll in rice paper - trying to stay away from fried. My wife also tried the Tom Yum soup which she initially thought was too tomato-based in its broth, but it grew on her to the point by the time she finished it, she said she did like it quite a bit. It was a fitting choice for a wet and cold afternoon. For the main course I had the Country Pad Thai, which was excellent, a very generous portion (especially for lunch) with about 2 ounces of chicken and 3 shrimp. Very flavorful, and had a little bit more of a kick than the regular Pad Thai. My wife had the Hamachi Sashimi which was fresh and tasty. Definitely would recommend this restaurant and we'll be back to try other things.---Fantastic! We were there with a large wedding party. The food was great, pasta wasnt mushy and the sauce was great. Service was fantastic! Even for our family asking for crazy stuff! We will come back whenever we are in town!---This place rocks!! I was visiting from Chicago and I love little coffee places with great coffee and amazing service! I was blown away! I had a mocha with brown sugar and a brownie. 4 shots of espresso kept me going for the 6 hour ride home. I'll be stopping here again on my next trip thru Clevland---Good food, ok service, beautiful decor. I had the Iskender kebab. I loved the meat itself; it was delicious. The tomato-ish sauce tasted nicely, and the yogurt was awesome, probably one of the best yogurts I've tested, with a beautiful homemade flair. The "croutons" were also perfect in consistency and flavor. I've been twice to this restaurant, and I like my Iskender so much that I had it both times. The baba ganoush was good, even for me (not a fan). It was very authentic tasting, and you could really feel that grilled flavor of the eggplant. Definitively, a must try. Angel - www.healthyroadadventures.blogspot.com---This place is amazing! If you are looking for fantastic food, excellent drinks, and friendly service - then you have found the right place. Whenever I've been here it takes me forever to order because I could literally eat anything on their menu. The bartenders are great and are there to make sure you enjoy your time. Make sure you see Phil behind the bar for a great experience!---Very good cheese pizza. Thin crust with a bit of char. I dined in, and the owner and his assistant left out the back door for the last 10 minutes I was there. Strange. I grabbed my own to-go box off the counter and left.---Our party visited Lucky's on Mother's Day morning, so we weren't surprised by the wait. The friendly hostess took our names, and we walked around lovely Tremont for an hour, then returned to Lucky's. Our name had already been called, but we were seated within a few minutes. Our waiter (a slim brown-haired youth with a mustache) was very attentive, fast, and friendly. He immediately noticed, as they were being set down by another server, that our water glasses had smudges, and returned momentarily with replacements. We had attentive service from additional servers, the food arrived very quickly, and the chef made her rounds to check on guests' satisfaction. Yes, the food is overpriced and the crowd at the door is off-putting. However, the mac & cheese is the best I've ever had, and the portion was big enough for me to take the leftovers home. The Vietnamese sandwich was also superb. Having visited similarly hip, mobbed establishments in other cities, my biggest pleasure at Lucky's was that not a single staff person was snooty and scenester-y.---I stopped in after reading the reviews on yelp. The staff was warm and outgoing,my sandwich, the Paisano was delicious,and they have real ginger beer in the soda fountain. Next time I'm in the valley I will stop in again.---I've always felt bad about the fact that I never really consider soup to be a meal. I think it mostly has to do with my love of sandwiches, and my previous inexperience with truly awesome soups. Enter, the Souper Market. It's a tiny place, a few counter seats to eat at, and I assume most of the business is done as carry out. It's a smallish menu, adjusted seasonally, made up of a selection of hot and cold soups, and a few salads. On this visit, I tried the Jambalaya, for which hearty is an understatement. I felt like I was eating a delicious bowl of pulled chicken. Also tried was the roasted corn gazpacho was tangy, and had some spicy kick to it. The real surprise was the Strawberry bisque. Maybe it's a melted milkshake, or smoothie, but whatever it is , it's delicious. I was tempted to try the spiced banana cold soup, but it wasn't in the cards today. All soup is served with a big slice of crusty artisan bread, and the prices are pretty reasonable. I'll be going back. Soon!---Are we allowed three updates for one place? I guess we are. I just want to chant "Hap-py Hour! Hap-py Hour!" every time I walk up to Light Bistro. But, I think I might need to change that chant to "Lamb Ka-bobs! Lamb Ka-bobs!" Or, if you ask my boyfriend, he might say the Chicago dog is really where the chant needs to be... Regardless, all of these items are $5 on the HH menu. No, I'm not kidding you. Add that to high-end beers, wines and martinis all ridiculously priced at $5 as well and you've got yourself a party. But, when your fabulous, handcrafted cocktails are even cheaper, at a $4 price-tag, your just asking yourself for the ultimate happy hour love. I'm sorry, but in my opinion, this is *the* destination for an upscale, fine-dinning, local-loving happy hour in Cleveland. You will not find a better deal. In fact, just from this awesome experience, I think I'm going to sit at the bar from now on--no matter what. Their 'tender teaches cocktail design all over the country and he's awesome. End of story.---Wow. The best food I've ever had on the west side the best service I've ever had. This without a doubt is my new wow. I can eat this everyday!!!---I like it, but I don't think it's worth the two hour wait they ALWAYS have. I usually put my name in and then go back home to hang out for an hour and a half (don't tell them you're leaving and then coming back, they don't like that). Or, you can always try to grab a seat at the bar that's first come first serve. It is an extremely small space, so when you get a table in the front of the dining area, they people that are waiting for a table are basically standing next to you. Love the extra dinner guests (not). Aside from that, the food is very good, and if you're going to be eating here, eat very lightly during the day because it will surely put you WAY about your daily calorie count. The fries are awesome, and they give you a decent amount. It you want something not too crazy and different, go for the melt burger--that is, if they still have it. I haven't been there since they have made a new menu. It looks like they have gotten rid of my favorite- the Cleveland Municipal Stadium, which had really awesome vodka kraut on it. If you're gonna do an appetizer, do the perogies. If you want to try out the place, refer back to my first paragraph: be prepared to wait!!!---This gyro was like if Buddy Holly came back from the grave, made an album collaborating with Big Bird, and then gave it away on band camp with a free knitted coaster with every download! Highly recommend!!!---Pros: -No smoking (driving out of state meant smoke filled casinos) -Won some money -Clean Cons: -No food other than the buffet which I did not want to spend $25 for (dinner price) I had a lot of fun :)---Going strong for 77 years and now under its fourth owner, Charles Thomas, we've frequented Rays Place since Jack Lambert partied here. Yes, THE Jack Lambert of KSU and Pittsburgh Steelers fame. Side Note: He had all his teeth then.) Beers on tap so numerous they change eight each month as new beers. Known as one of the first bars in the US to televise football games. Great sandwiches with many burger choices. Opens at 11 through 2:30 am with a special "late night" menu after 11 pm. Noisy late at night with students. Pleasant until then with distincltly different lunch and dinner crowds. The phone booth doesn't work any more but that is the only change in all these years. Known by parents of all KSU grads with no bad references. Come and enjoy a burger and a brew at Rays. Edited to add: These men have also been known to eat and drink here: Rich Rollins, Thurman Munson, Steve Stone, Nick Sabin and Josh Cribbs.---I have stayed here twice now, traveling between the East Coast and Midwest, to visit family. Both times have been great. I was a little scared the first time when I pulled up and saw the super old exterior, but the interior is actually very nice. The rooms appear to have been recently redone, are large and comfortable. The staff both times has been very friendly. If I need to be near I-80 this is my choice in the Cleveland area. Recommended!---My wife and I came to Cleveland Ohio for a little weekend getaway. I googled and did a lot of research on places to get a great burger. the 2 that came up a lot were Tremont tap house and Bspot burgers. Well In my opinion Tremont topped Bspot burgers with no competition. We arrived and from the outside looks like a little hole in the wall place, but when you walk in it livens up real quick. they were able to seat us right away and within a few seconds our waitress greeted us, very friendly and with a big smile. We ordered a couple beers. With a burger I always order some kind of IPA, I feel that they pair amazingly with burgers. I wanted to try sometrhing I have not had before and being from grand rapids michigan , cleveland had a lot I have not heard of. She was very knowledgeable of the beers on tap and bottled and was even nice enough to let us sample some of the beers on tap. We finaly chose our beer and next up were the burger choices. I ordered the bacon cheeseburger plain but you can't go wrong with that. I ordered my burger and both my wife and I asked for it to be medium rare. They brought out the burger with fries . Gotta say these fries were amazing. I bit into my burger to find a warm pink lightly bloody perfectly cooked center in the middle. Oh my I was in heaven, and the beer was the perfect ending to the pallet. I would for sure come here again and to those who read and have not been there go try it out. Yes there burgers are a little more pricey but for a good burger you can't put a price on it....---We come to this location often. They have a different menu than their location in Woodmere. The Malaysian food and the sushi are very good. They are usually quite busy. If you are a fan of spicy food you can order your food extra spicy and they'll put birds eye chilies in it. Whether or not it comes out very spicy or with a lot of the chilies, really just depends on which server you get.---I really meant to be good, honest. No, really, I did! Like most people my age I have to work hard to watch my weight. The plan today was to order the Roasted Duck on Noodles HK Style soup and the Salt Baked Calamari (which I had last week...omg, can't begin to tell you...). BUT, I was only going to have a piece or two of the calamari and take the rest home for dinner. What happened? Well...flavors happened. Big, bold, amazing, addicting, stupidly-great flavors happened. It wasn't my fault at all. They hijacked my willpower, put it into a plastic bag along with two 30 pound weights and tossed it overboard into the deepest and darkest part of Lake Erie. Like taking candy from a retired person. I was done. The soup was just outstanding (see pic) to the last tiny droplet. I would order it again in a nanosecond. And that calamari...my vocabulary and writing skills aren't up to the task of expressing how flavorful it was. It's my new BFF (best fish forever). Chill, Marine Biologists, I know it's a cephalopod. I usually don't like restaurants that are cramped, noisy, and look like they were decorated by a sophomore linebacker from Ohio State, but Wonton Gourmet is my favorite Asian restaurant in this city by FAR. And since I'm usually one of only a handful (if that) of Caucasians present, I'd say that's an opinion shared by people who know a hell of a lot more than I about this kind of food.---My husband and I went there for lunch today because we had a $10 coupon off of a $30 or more purchase. We'll be back. Neither of us are beer drinkers but I had one of the best raspberry ice teas ever and I know ice tea. The food is above what you expect in a chain restaurant and there is a lot of it. I had the fish and chips - don't order this unless you are really hungry - huge servings and way too many waffle chips which were delicious. My husband had a flat bread with pepperoni and he loved it. It really fits in well with Legacy Village. Service was great too. A very nice selection on the menu.---Great, fresh food. I've only been for brunch but I've never had a bad meal! It's a little small inside so if you're going on a weekend make sure to get there early before the line...and before the quiche of the day runs out!---If you like big food, you are gonna love the Red Hawk. The portions are huge, and the food has always come out hot and tasty! The service is very good and the place is clean. They have a full service bar, with seating in the bar and the main dining room, so if you want a quiet meal, sit in the main dining room. The bar is a vibrant and busy spot, so if you like it a little noisier, the bar is for you! All in all, it is a pretty great place for a meal. You will most likely be going home with leftovers!---Since this was an Irish pub, I wasn't sure the Gyro would be the best choice But what a pleasant surprise--it was one the best Gyro's I ever had. Plenty of lamb and Sauce Also had a great selection of craft and bottled beers Will definitely come back whenever I'm in this Twinsburg area---This was a great diner. I went here with my two 4-year old sons after visiting the Great Lakes Science Center for a late lunch. It is smallish and you can definitely feel the family-nature of the place. The servers were down-to-earth and helpful for a dad out with his boys. I had eggs with corned beef hash. Huge serving of terrific hash with fresh green peppers and a large amount of corned beef. Have to say it was some of the best hash I have had. My kids had scrambled eggs and pancakes. Both were great. The coffee was hot and plentiful.---Wonderful time with friends tonight! Warm atmosphere with tasty food. I think the Rita could of used a little more tequila , but just look at the size of the pineapple chicken we ordered !!!---Been here many time. Always good. Great value. Great quality. Extensive menu. Sushi is best in the county. This place is my go to sushi.---Stopped in after looking at options near our hotel. Wound up here for lunch. Place was fairly busy but we were seated right away. Quite an extensive list of bottle and draught beers. Our waitress was quick to take our orders and bring us our food. Our group enjoyed the Carolina pulled pork sandwich; Bourbon brisket sandwich (had a great smoked flavor) and the fish sandwich. Also ordered fried Mac n cheese wedges. With drinks- apps and main meal, bill was around $40- very reasonable. Paper placemats had the beer menu as well as a variety of food and drink specials that occur throughout the week/month. Good spot and would come here again on return trips to CLE---Don't drive by. It's not just a bar. The staff is very friendly. Food was great. Crab legs every day. They will accommodate your requests.---Johnny Mango's is a great stop in Ohio City. One of those places everyone talks about. It's a really cute place. They have a brunch menu on Saturday and Sunday and their regular menu has a nice variety of Mexican/Caribbean inspired food, such as quesadillas, burritos and the like. I ordered huevos rancheros from the brunch menu for $7. I also asked for avocado on the side but note - it wasn't worth the $1 extra for the tiny cup. My plate was much bigger than I was expecting for the price! Beans, huevos rancheros topped with salsa and onion and cheese. I would definitely recommend that entree. I'd like to come back and try taco Tuesday, but I've heard it gets really crowded. They also have a happy hour from 3-7pm with half priced beers. Small patio on the side for outdoor seating. Street parking was plentiful on a Saturday afternoon.---There's a reason we have been there three times in the past week. Spice that's so refreshing and just pops in your mouth with bright crisp delightful flavor! The Indian food is Rich, warm, filling and definitely one of the more unique flavors now in Cleveland Heights. And very well priced. I haven't had mango lassi like that in a long time and it really takes me back to times in India. I haven't yet tried the Greek food, because I can't stop eating the Indian food. Strongly. Encourage everyone in the nearby community to support this lovely new business. I really appreciate that the cafés open early in the morning, I only wish that it were open for dinner time. Anticipate that in the future it will be a great place to lounge, snack on the okra fries, sip on Mango Lassi, and read a book or peruse the Internet---Absolutely gorgeous!!!! They have a beautiful indoors and an even better patio. Great idea for date night. They have a wide selection of beers. We got 2 different samplers and tried their flavors. Loved all of the samplers. Would definitely recommend!!---Wow. I was in town visiting family. The food was amazing! We each had different dishes and no one was disappointed. Service was excellent. Next time I am in town from Texas, I will have to make it a point to stop in again. Bring your appetite. The portions are very generous!---Not the greatest pulled pork I've ever had, but its good and probably the best in the area. I'm a little surprised by the other reviews because my experience was good. This place is brand new, so there might be some issues training new people. Give them a chance.---I had one of their antioxidant smoothies no. 4 {whole ginger, pineapple apple, strawberry + detox 1 & hubs had one of their Plant Fix juices no. 8 {spinach, kale, pear, lemon + ginger. Juice was good, mild in flavor. Smoothie was excellent but wished mine was served in a glass bottle as I am not a fan of the plastic cup/straw mine was served in.---Soooo I've avoided this place because I heard not so great remarks about it when I first set foot on campus. I don't know who I was talking to, but they were WRONG! Guacamole's is great! The restaurant was clean, bright, and spacious. The food portions were HUGAMONGOUS!!! (While that's not normally a big selling point for me, I totes got 3 meals out of 1! and it tasted good!!!) They have millions (ok, maybe 10) of flavors for margs for those crazy college kids. I stuck w/ the el standard one, it was okay, but I quickly moved on to my Negro Modelo. Negro Modelo, you are so yummy! The chips were good & crunch, the salsa was salsa...nothing to write home about. But mixed w/ the spicy salsa, it ain't too shabby. The service wasn't fabulous, but it wasn't awful. What do you expect at 9pm w/ a group of college girls though? Our waiter did manage to keep our water glasses filled though. Will I go back, heck yeah. You should too. Just don't drink all the Negro Modelo before I get there! :)---We went there for my brother's birthday. Our waitress was great. The food is a bit pricey. The dessert was amazing. Overall, it was a good experience.---Greasy Burgers until 1am? Check Downtown? Check. Un-pretentious? Check. Gin and Tonics and draught beer until 2am? Check. Crowds of 22 year olds getting drunk and throwing up on their "going-out" clothes? Around the corner and up the street at the Blind Pig.---I hadn't eaten at Panda Wok in almost 10 years (what can I say? I'm a Chinese take-out snob) and was skeptical even after my boyfriend gave it his take-out seal of approval after we heard it had re-opened. We went for dinner tonight and I was impressed right away with decor, cleanliness of the restaurant, and friendliness of the staff. I had the wonton soup, crab rangoon (delicious but in need of more yummy filling), and the amazingly delicious Panda sushi roll (yes, they have a sushi bar). My boyfriend had the hot and sour soup (he's a connoisseur and gave it high praise) and the Singapore noodles- spicy, which were delicious. We will definitely go back and also try their take-out menu soon.---Delicious as close to a West Coast Japanese restaurant as possible. Enjoy the small traditional style restaurant. Great spicy sushi selections along with the traditional tonkatsu.---My fiancé and I live really close to this new burger place so we decided to walk there on a Friday evening. At first glance, the menu looked innovative and fun! I love the option of picking your own protein (burger, chicken, pulled pork, etc) and bun! Instead of a bun, you can opt for a bed of salad greens or even a gluten free waffle (I can't wait to try that next!). There beer list is pretty impressive and, I agree with the other reviewer, that I wish they had a bar to go with it. There were 6 beers on tap and also they have some old school sodas you can choose from as well. I ordered the Palo Alto burger on a whole wheat bun and it was delicious. We share their bucket of fries with garlic aioli sauce and beer cheese on the side. The fries include one sauce, I wish you could try them all at once (they are 50 cents for each extra one you add). All in all, we are looking forward to returning to this cute burger joint.---When this place first re-opened I was a little unsure at first and now I can't get enough! Living right next door is such an added bonus! The bartenders are great and the food is all so fun and very interesting. The chicken parm, turkey leg, and fat kid 2.0 are all amazing! If youre feeling spontaneous order a "Penicillin," its a fun scotch cocktail thats not on the menu that Im kind of in love with. Wish it was open later but that's the only negative I can even come up with. Plus daily popcorn flavors.. YUM.---
