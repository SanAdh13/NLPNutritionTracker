One of the best sub places that I've ever found, their subs are really unique (in my experience at least). Great bread, great ingredients, and their 'secret sauce' (aka salad dressing) is wonderful. There are a ton of subs to choose from, but the names are all so absurd (The ______ Dave) that it can be quite difficult to figure out what to get. Hence, I almost always get the #1. I've never had a bad service experience; coming back to town after being gone for a year, the woman who usually works the counter remembered my usual order without any prompting. The hippie memorabilia is a little nauseating (where else can you see a family tree of The Choir?) but thats their thing; too bad Dave drives an Escalade. Seating is very limited, but I have almost never encountered anyone else in the place.---I really love this place for home style Mexican. The folks in my office like OCB as much as I do and fortunately, they deliver. Chicken burrito = heaven. The chicken is so flavorful and delicious and it's shredded with no fat, just how I like it. They offer VEGETARIAN re-fried beans, which is a big deal for a non-pork eater like me, and also offer just about all the toppings you'd get at Chipotle...only much better.---Came here for lunch on a Sunday. Service and food were great! I had the salmon blt wrap with the sweet potato fries and it was fantastic! Can't wait to come back here in the summer when the patio is open.---Bold statement: Mason's has the best salted caramel ice cream I've ever had. The staff is helpful and vibrant, and the flavors this week (including Thai Tea) won my heart over.---Glad to see that a new restaurant is open close to work. Went during lunch with a co-worker. She had shrimp tacos; I had the carne asada tacos. Both were delicious and perfect for lunch. Atmosphere was nice and warm. My only complaint was the server. I had asked her about the concept of the restaurant (farm to table, scratch kitchen, etc.), and she didn't seem to understand. Another server was explaining to her table about using farm fresh produce, Amish chicken, fresh beef, beer selection, etc. Glad I was able to overhear that. It was their first week open, so I hope by now she has a clue. Also, my friend order shrimp tacos and received pork. You'd think they would have been refired right away, but we had to wait another 20 minutes for her food, which put us way over our lunch hour. Hoping it was just opening bumps in the road, so I'll give them another try.---Noooooo! My favorite fried bologna sandwich wasn't available the last time I was there. Their vendor changed their bologna. I hope they are able to resolve this quickly. All of their specialty burgers are also quite good. Their smoked turkey reuben is also very good. Their draft beer menu is huge and I like trying a different beer every time that I go. Buckeye Beer Engine is definitely one of my favorite places.---My friend and I were exploring the Tremont area and walking along and found Fat Cats. We decided to stop for lunch and rehydration since it was a very hot day and we had been walkng for some time. We were seated immediately and menus arrived. My friend ordered a salad and I got one of their sandwiches, both of which were very good. We sat for some time and there was no problem with this. The staff was most accommodating and the waitress attentive. I would recommend and return when I return to Cleveland.---Amazing tasting grilled cheese with bacon and tomatoes! Tomato soup is good too! Got the combo for $6 and it was such a good deal! Going back soon for sure!---Great fresh Mexican food. All vegetables and lean proteins. The manager is exceptional at making you feel welcomed. He is passionate about his restaurant and his employees. Gives great suggestions!---Fantastic place.... Tammy,Matt and Dawn the manager were awesome... The atmosphere was incredible and super clean. Beer was cold and service was second to none. Two thumbs up. Will def be back when I'm in town.---Flannery's is a nice place to go for a couple of beers. The food is decent. I never suggest to friends that we go here. I am usually taken here by somebody. Nothing too cool has ever happened to me here. I am really drawing a blank on this one.---Loved it. Plan on coming back. Good price for the style of place it is. Liked our waiter Matthew and plan to ask for him when we go again---Good food, good prices and nice atmosphere.Family owned which is important to me, don't like chain restaurants.---Here visiting from FL. We were lucky. We came in on a Thursday when they have their Tasty Thursday 3 course menu. I enjoyed the bourbons paired with each course. The pumpkin pie is to die for. Brandon, the bartender, is awesome!---This is a bar, boarder line dive bar. They also serve food. Six sandwiches to order from and REALLY cheap beer. Pastrami and corned beef we good, very simple, sandwiches.---This place really is a Mexican gem in Old Brooklyn, where I currently reside. My wife and I really enjoy mexican cuisine and would probably eat it daily if we could. This place really hits the spot, and does it in style. A few things set this place apart from restaurants like El Campasino and the like. Firstly, it is very CLEAN. It doesn't have that grungy feel like some mexican restaurants exude. Secondly, it has very fast SERVICE. From my experience, other places like this have average at best service speed and accuracy-wise. This place also has a menu chock full of delicious burritos, tacos and the like, nothing monumental, but they do give extremely generous portions and it always tastes great! Also, the prices are very fair (average price for a giant burrito with beans and rice is $8.50 or so). I've yet to have a bad experience here and would recommend it to anyone in the area.---I have mixed feelings about Great Lakes Brewery. On the one hand, it's a Cleveland landmark and I do love their brews. On the other hand, I think their food needs an upgrade for being such a go-to spot. If you're down with bar food, great, but I've ordered their specials before and felt there was much to be desired. But their beer though...and they are sustainable! I will move this from a 3 to 4 just for what they do for the community and the environment.---Typically stop in whenever we head to WSM. Always has been a good time. They have a good beer selection, both their own brews and other craft beers. Haven't had a full meal here yet, only snacks, but looking forward to trying their full menu. The staff has always been friendly and the service quick. Will continue to stop in on our visits to WSM.---Excellent grouper dinner, delightful ambience right in the theater district. Highly recommend this restaurant before or after the theater.---I'm here every Tuesday after biking with friends in the valley. Simply saying Taco Tuesday does not do justice to the uniqueness of their taco selection; Spicy Shrimp, Tuna, Pork ...etc. Add in the special taco - anything from sausage and lamb to walleye and turtle (yes turtle). Pair with a wide variety of craft beers, wine and specialty drinks, The main menu boasts the same unique qualities - having had pomme' frites, duck fat popcorn, mussels, chicken and waffles ...etc. Not a bad selection from top to bottom. Lastly I cannot say enough regarding their staff. As restaurants go my friends and I have never felt more welcomed or attended to. Yes we've become familiar faces to them. However as you notice their interaction and sense of customer care with others you can really appreciate the effort they put in to every guest.---Great patio and even more amazing burgers. I had a burger stuffed with blue cheese and bacon and covered in buffalo sauce. It was huge! The service was excellent and we will definitely be going back. Love it!---Great food and plenty of craft brews to choose from. Its always busy for this reason. It's worth a wait if there is one. You will not leave hungry. Portions are truly filling and at a good price. We always take home extra food.---Tis' the season for soup, er, zoup. I particularly enjoy the variety of soup here, I think they have around 10 different soups daily. The handsome young feller working offered us samples of whichever one we wanted to try; I felt like I was at the ice cream store. I got a side of soup which can be paired with a half sandwich or salad. I chose a half salad with the lobster bisque (which was FULL of lobster, yum) and it was plenty of food. I got a fountain drink and my meal was less than $10. I couldn't finish everything as it was a thick soup and my niece was being a 2-year old and we had to see Santa. I'd definitely recommend and will surely go back and try some other soups and sandwiches.---The Parmesan truffle pomme frites are amazing. I've been here twice and both times were great! I've had the duck confit Mac n cheese which was beyond good and the spicy shrimp tacos- also great! The cocktails are good too! I highly recommend this restaurant.---Favorite neighborhood greasy spoon. Been goin here since i was a lil kid. Donna's the best damn waitress in all of Cleveland!!! All the gals there hustle to take care of you. Place definitely could use a scrubbin and a make over but who cares as long as my food isnt gross. Food is good, staff is awesome. Quick turn around so don't plan on hoggin a table for any amount of time. Love their chicken soup! When we're sick i swing by and order 4-8 cups to bring home---Went here for my 21st Birthday and was pleasantly surprised. Let me start by saying that I was BLOWN AWAY by the 28 beers on tap and then the 5 pages...yes, I said 5 pages, of bottles that they had. To top off the amazing selection of beer, the food was also excellent. We started with boneless wings and Perogi which were both perfectly prepared. For my entree I had Fish & Chips which was also just perfect. The shoestring fries were perfectly seasoned and crispy and the fish had the flaky, rich beer battered breading on it which I absolutely love. Overall, Awesome service, great environment and even better food and beer. Can't go wrong at the Buckeye Beer Engine!---This restaurant is surprisingly nice. I had a quick dinner with some friends and enjoyed a drink and a beverage in the dining room. It was just past peak dinnertime so it was a little noisy, but not unbearable. Our server was nice and helped me select an entree that could be made vegan. My non-vegan friends ordered a veggie burger, a salmon dish, and some tacos and were all pleased. The crowd favorite was the huge order of homemade chips that came with one friend's meal. I'd definitely go back to Tavern Six again - especially to check out what seems like a great patio!---Wow - I was really impressed by this place. I didn't even know they existed until today but I will certainly be back now that I am in the know! The decor is cute and as another reviewer said, you feel like you are in a hip Tremont restaurant. The service was very good - not so quick that you feel rushed but not too slow. My husband and I ordered the queso dip for an appetizer and it was amazing. Very flavorful and just enough heat but not overly spicy. I had to resist licking the bowl with a finger. I had the chicken empanadas which were perfectly done. I love the fact that you can choose your dish (emanadas, burrito, taco...) and then choose the filling. My husband got the trio platter which was a burrito, taco and enchilada. He said they were all excellent and very flavorful. You could definitely tell that everything was freshly made. No sauce from a can here. Presentation of everything was very well done. All our dishes were very attractive. And the margarita.... YUM! I hate going to a place and getting a margarita that is made from a mix. Once you have a "real" one, you never want the mix again. Real is exactly what you get here. They are flavorful and expertly made. I love the fact they have such a large variety of tequila here and that you can chose what tequila you want your margarita made with. I will recommend Taqueria Junction to everyone and I will definitely be back! As for price, I think they are reasonable. You are getting fresh food freshly made. Don't expect the super cheap prices of some mexican restaurants in the area because the quality of food here is far superior to most of the local mexican restaurants in town. The $8 and change I paid for my emanadas was well worth it. I got three, huge emanadas for the money and I felt it was worth it. Margaritas start at $6.95 (I believe) and they are worth it.---First trip here and I have to say I enjoyed it. Small, cozy, nice lighting, but with TV's at the same time. Food was pretty good, price was good, and even had half off bottles of wine tonight. The fun part was the wine doggy bag you get with wine you didn't drink. I will definitely return.---The first time we went, it was OK. It was a Friday night. About an hour wait, but the bar, although busy, was attentive. They also found us amongst the sea of people when our table was ready. I realized I put way too much on my tacos that night. Sauce, salsa... They were super mucky, but my bad for being over ambitious. The same story the second time around, but I had learned my lesson on taco creation. Two tacos- shrimp, jicama slaw, cheese, & tomato soft taco, & the beef, cheese, corn salsa tomato soft taco. Brilliant! The shrimp /jicama combo is crunchy, sweet & perfect. Love the corn salsa. Paired with blood orange margaritas, it was perfect. Not the best tacos ever, but worth the weekend wait. It's pretty hipster, but that hasn't negatively impacted our experience.---As far as I know, this and China Sea by CSU are the only Taiwanese restaurants in the northeast Ohio area. Phusion Cafe definitely delivers, with the trademark Taiwanese staples of three cup chicken, Taiwanese sausage fried rice, and Peddler noodles. Above all else, Phusion Cafe has by far the best bubble tea in Cleveland, which is to be expected considering their tea is based on TenRen Tea Time's recipes. I particularly love the lychee bubble tea, which has a very strong natural fruit flavor to it. This is THE place I go to, to satisfy my cravings for Taiwanese food.---The pizza was amazing! Stopped in for a few slices, tried both the pepperoni and the cheese- they were both so delicious. The space in there is very limited but you can take your pizza next door to enjoy. The prices are great too.---Folks if you get the opportunity to come here ima thinking you won't be disappointed,Our stand up was Matt Braunger and good stuff is all I can speakage!! And the service was TOPS!!!! them folks deserve a raise...Food,drinks,laughter and great service deserves a "BAM"GETCHA SUM!!!---Sokolowski's is a true Cleveland institution-and my family and I enjoy going whenever possible. The portions are nicely sized, beer selection is varied, and the atmosphere friendly. I love that the piano player greets us each time by playing my grandma's favorite song. I must go back soon for a dessert with my meal-those are so attractive at the start of the line!---Excellent food! The potstickers were a delicious surprise for sure! Kelsey, you are a gem! Excellent food and extraordinary service. Thank you for having fun with us!---I'm a frequent customer. It's a great deli for lunch or take home, with friendly service. They have a large selection and the portions are very generous (especially the sandwiches). The fries, soups and sandwiches are very, very good. The soups are "homemade" and delicious (try the vegetarian chili) and there are lots of choices. This is one my favorite places.---This place is amazing! Friendly staff, fresh food, a little taste of Mexico in Ohio! Would definitely come back for more! Ask for their ceviche or shrimp coctel (its a type of soup). 10/10---Perch Dinner Review: I've been to "The Boulevard" several times for the Friday Perch Dinner. I think it's the best perch dinner around and I've been to most Friday Fish places in Akron and Cuyahoga Falls. You'll get a decent portion of fresh perch, great bread, and your choice of two side dishes for around $12. If you have an experienced (picky) "perch palate", and it's late July through September, you might prefer the fresh, Lake Erie "jumbo" yellow perch that are in-season and likely available as "Specials" at a shrinking number of other places. Of course, compared to $20/lb (market price) for the jumbos, you'll get an essentially BOGO deal on excellent, eco-friendly, farm-raised perch at The Boulevard. If you can eat dinner early, get here before 5:15 to avoid waiting a few minutes for a table. You'll also be more likely to get one of the limited parking spots.---If you're a fan of deliciously unhealthy sandwiches, you'll love Twisted Meltz. After trying the double James Harrison, I'm going to have a hard time finding a more flavorful and filling sandwich. Burgers, bacon, and onion rings complement each other unsurprisingly well. It's fairly heavy, so not something you'd want to order every day, but it makes for the perfect cheat meal. The battered fries and fried pickles, although a bit soft because it was a takeout order, were still on par with the sandwiches, and both were reasonably priced. For the not-so-health-conscious, I'd definitely recommend Twisted Meltz for classic melt sandwiches with a creative twist.---This location has the best patio in the Cleveland area. It feels like each seating area is secluded and there is an ample amount of shade provided by the 2 giant tress inside of the area. I can't get enough time outside during the short Cleveland summers, so that's why I chose this place to meet up with friends I haven't seen in a year. My main reason for choosing this place was solely for the patio, but I will definitely go back rain or shine. The food is that freaking good! Oh wait, we had drinks first so I should talk about them. There are plenty of local and craft beers on tap and there is a decent variety. I started off with Revolution's Anti Hero. As I perused the cocktail section, I knew I would be switching. Beer before liquor, never sicker!---Yummy food good prices clean space and great ownership. The foundation of a great start to a great place. Everytime I go I try something new but the rib tips are out of sight good. Keep up the great work!---Had an unexpected night out with friends last week and The Solon area was the easiest place for us to meet. We chose Burntwood and had such an amazing evening! Ambiance- loved the rustic interior! Food- salads, flatbreads and sliders were all simply delicious! Service- David our server, made our night out memorable! He was very helpful, always smiling and very attentive to our needs! We shall definitely return, and request him!!! He is AWESOME!!!---I think the restaurant is great. I love the food. The only issue i have had is that sometimes they like to over-char some dishes (sometimes the pizza but for sure the Brussel sprouts). If I could change one thing it would be that they take reservations. They do not take reservations and I have always had to wait. It makes me hesitant to go there and also to invite other people as I do not know how long the wait will be. It has been up to an hour long.---An awesome dive bar with great ribs on the west side! Despite living practically across the street for months, I never stepped foot inside for food other than the occasional beer. I'm happy to say I've had their St. Louis styled ribs with a cajun dry rub and was impressed. The meat was well cooked, the seasoning was fantastic and the sides - fries and coleslaw, were fantastic. Decent drink selection too.---Hands down, my favorite place to eat when I have the chance. You can't go wrong with anything off of the menu! I usually get hummos and a rolled, usually falafel hummos. I do ask them to exclude the turnip and pickle (yuck). The mujadara and chicken salad are delicious. I have also had their side salad which is pretty impressive! You can't go wrong with the Aladdins Kabob rolled. You can't help but notice their deserts when you walk in! Save room if you can indulge in one of their delicious cheese cakes. The only weird thing about this place is that you have to walk through the kitchen to use the rear entrance or rest room.---This place has something for everyone- it has to because I think there are over 100 choices on the menu. It's great whether you are a vegetarian or carnivore. And the milkshakes are out of this world. We are partial to the pita sandwiches, loaded with cheese and goodness. The breakfasts are great as well, with some unusual choices such as the Mr. Stress which is a BLT with peanut butter and mayo on it. Today I tried the Quinn. It is a pita with six kinds of melted cheese, some veggies and peanut butter. It was surprisingly good. Typically I order the Zippy and my wife orders that Quigly. Both are excellent. Today we ordered a kids pancake for our son which was just okay. The batter was a little thick and made the cake somewhat heavy. If you are in the area, or not in the area, be sure to swing into Tommy's for an excellent meal.---We came at a really busy time so service was sort of slow but our waitress was good. Super friendly and the drinks were good, food was excellent. I ordered garlic pasta and it was to die for. It was a little loud for my liking and there were tons of families in there for a sunday afternoon. Tbis happens to be b onenof my favorite places to eat in the Crocker Park area.---We stopped into Mr. Brisket for lunch today and were pleasantly surprised. The pastrami and corned beef were outstanding and the people were super friendly. It's carry out only, but I wished they had a few tables outside where we could enjoy them.---The best Indian restaurant I have ever been to. Decent ambience, medium spicy and authentic Indian dishes, yummy gulab jamun (probably the best I have ever had) put together satisfy our desire for Indian food to a large extent. Will highly recommend to all Cleveland based Indians out there!---Really tasty burger. Ambiance was not my cup of tea. A lobster claw game??? $3 claw game were you can grapple your own lobster and win a seafood dinner? WTF, Ohio, WTF?---I eat here all of the time. Usually the service in the bar area is slow, but if they realize it, they make up for it with a free appetizer without having to say a word or show any kind of frustration. Serving staff has great personalities and great sense of humor---Amazing sushi! Best sushi for miles around! All you can eat! Great service! Can't complain when your happy!---My parents go here as a treat to themselves about once a month and they finally decided to bring me. I am so thankful that they did. This was the best pizza I've ever had ever. The atmosphere when you walk in it's so cozy. It also helps that you're greeted with a gelato bar. It's a very quaint place with brick walls covered in art by a local photographer. The brick oven is where these fabulous pizzas are made but you can watch. It has a variety of meats and cheeses and specialty pizzas all cooked right in front of you. The best type of meat and the best type of cheese are combined on top of delicious though and Drool-worthy the sauce. This is not your standard pizza. It makes you feel like you are in Italy with all the taste that it has. I cannot eat dairy so I was a little scared to go to the new pizza place where I had to ask for a pizza without cheese but with all the flavors that they put into every single ingredient that's on their pizza it was mind blowing and my taste buds have never been happier. I cannot wait to go back to this amazing place in Cleveland---My wife and I have enjoyed meals at this wonderful restaurant many times, in every season. Most every dish has been scrumptious. The service is consistently friendly and conscientious. The patio is lovely in the summer, and the dining rooms are elegant yet cozy in the winter. It's a bit of cliche to admit this, but the classic Cassoulet may be our favorite. It is so complex, flavorful, and satisfying. "French toast," which also boasts layers of taste and texture, is always one of our appetizers. There's almost nothing that we don't love about L'Albatros, it's probably our favorite Cleveland restaurant!---I had make your own with pita and beef. It's a fancy chipotle concept for mediterranean food. Good eat. The smoothie for $2.50 is a steal!---Goldie's has the best breakfast buffet in strongsville. Service is the key to this restaurants success. Servers are patient, fast and polite. I would recommend Goldie's to anyone who wants a good meal---What a unique spot. It used to be an old barn. It used to be a house of yarn. :) Loved the decor! Not your typical steakhouse leather and cigar bar. Our server was amazing. She helped guide us to all the goodies which included: Hummus appetizer was yummy (hey - even a steakhouse can do good veggies!) The tater tots, which were larger than I expected AND amazing. I had the Boliermaker which was a center cut ribeye. I was warned It was good but I would get the bone-in next time. Someone else got the Waygu and it was like a dinosaur. Get this if you have a dog...he will LOVE you and you will be more than happy with the cut. The sided were wonderful too. The gruyere mac n cheese and the lobster pasta. I could not decide which one I loved more. I think we had a vegetable but I cannot remember for the life of me. Great place if you find yourself in Avon.---My wife and I first came here for dinner on our anniversary last year and it was great. While we were sitting at the table, we noticed a wine tasting promotion they had at the table and we were intrigued. I am not a big wine connoisseur (far from it)... what caught my eye was the description of the different courses (which included sea bass, duck, and ostrich). The price tag was $75 per person and that included tax and tip and it was well worth it (to justify the expense, we refrained from eating out for the month before). There were six courses in all and each came with a glass of wine that was paired with the food. The first course was an appetizer and the final course was a dessert (with a dessert wine) and the other four were small meals unto themselves. Each course was amazing and we were so stuffed by the time the dessert arrived. I recommend going to one of these if you notice they are having one (I haven't seen any lately... maybe they only do it in the winter time?). This place has excellent service and great food. It's a little pricier than our average "night out" so we mostly reserve it for special occasions.---Don't be confused, Nate's Deli and Resturant offers both american and middle eastern foods, open only for breakfast and lunch. The diner is very casual, food was delicious yet simple, and the serves was warm and motherly (a lot of "honey" and "sweetheart"). Hummus was smooth and creamy, tangy, pinched with parsley, dashed with paprika and a drippled of olive oil. It's served with commercial pita bread heated from the plastic bag. Delicious yet simple. All for $2.75. (Later that night, I wish I could jump back in time. So I could have ordered some hummus togo) I order a gyro (I like hogpog meats) and bf ordered beef kabob. Mine was smeared with dill-less tzatziki, over what appeared to be re-heated gyro meat and crispy white onions blanket in a warm, chewy thick pita bread. I finished it. The bf enjoyed his selection. I thought about it, I already knew what I wanted to try the next time--tabbouleh and baba ganoush.---Great ambiance and service. We had the half a pig head which was great however, my son had the pasta which was very good but the portion size was very small. Kinda expensive but I'd go back again.---I've never had a disappointing meal here, although some of my experiences were better than others. Most recently, I came in on a Saturday night for dinner with a large group of friends. My friend L handled making a reservation ahead of time, and mentioned that they were very easy to work with. We ended up having a whole dining area to ourselves (it was a party of 25-30), and our own bar. I would have liked if the staff could have made it more clear that we were a private party as early in the night (initially we had 5-6 of us there), we kept having random people try to sit with us. And every single one of them ignored us when we politely tried to tell them that we were a private party - the bartender had to tell most of them more than once. We showed up early, and let the staff know if they were not ready for us, we could wait in the main area. The (rather good looking) bartender let us know that it was okay with him, if we were okay that he wasnt' fully set up yet. We were only about 30 min early, but for the next hour plus, half of the drinks he made, he had to go to the main bar. I'm not sure what that was about. We had our friends coming in waves, so hopefully we didn't overwhelm him. There wasn't quite enough room for us at the tables that they had set up, so several of us ended up sitting at the bar (which was perfectly fine with us, but i know some of our friends were a little disappointed). A few staff occasionally came over to help out Hot Bartender, but he mostly handled us on his own. There were a few snafus with checks, but overall everyone seemed happy. The food was great, although several people had to repeatedly ask for their appetizers (including guacamole which honestly should not have taken about an hour to arrive). We probably had better service sharing one bartender for 30 people than i have on most other occasions (a recent dining out included me drinking my margarita, my water, and then going to get my drinks from the bar because I literally couldn't get my server's attention for almost an hour). The margaritas are awesome, although my friend was disappointed that they did not have frozen ones. The blood orange and pepper ones were my favorite. And definitely go for the mole sauce!---Love this place. Chicken noodle soup is delicious. I got the soup, steak, eggs, hash browns, toast, and coffee for 9.50. Not only is it affordable, but the location it great for me, always get seated quickly, and the food is great. Couldn't ask for more out of a diner.---The bread, the bread, the bread...and that's only the beginning. Tonight we started off with the calamari which was lightly dusted with flour and fried and seasoned to perfection. Next my wife and I opted to split a large pepperoni and onion pizza which is our favorite. The toppings were plentiful and the crust and cheese were cooked to perfection. Really you can't go wrong with anything on the menu whether it's pizza or any of the other traditional Italian staples. The best part was calamari, lg 2 topping pizza, and two soft drinks and we walked out of there with leftovers for $27 plus a $6 dollar tip. That's a lot of food for not a lot of money which will make most anyone happy. One more thing...even on an off night...which every restaurant has from time to time...the service is always excellent and tonight was no different.---Came here a couple times with my husband. Service and food were great, except the portions are too big unless you are sharing a plate. Great restaurant for families or large appetites. Wish they had smaller items on the menu.---A chance encounter gave me the opportunity to sample Choolaah's fare before their grand opening coming up on November 28th, and I was very thankful for that chance after looking back on the visit! The manager I encountered was incredibly kind and had good service in mind throughout the entire experience. She showed the open windows that looked into the kitchen to allow guests a chance to view the cooking ovens in action along with their walk-in refrigerators and freezers to get an idea of the quality of ingredients in use before any order could be placed. After giving me a quick overview of the menu, I picked the Tikka Masala bowl with chicken and a side order of Wheat Naan. I was given a buzzer and told the food would take about 3-5 mintues to prepare and pick up later from the side counter (similarly to Panera's buzzer-based pickup system). The service was much quicker than that expectation, but the place also wasn't open yet either! Always having regular Naan at any sit-down Indian restaurant that I have been to previously, I wasn't sure what to expect with the Wheat Naan nor did I have anything to compare the quality towards having been a first-time try, but I was very pleased with the taste. The bowl was also delicious and the fresh ingredients were apparent in the flavor. I was given the option to make it spicier, but turned that down for my first try. The default spiciness was a great level for me, but I worry that Indian-food newbies might be turned off from it if they don't know what to expect. The only constructive criticism I could come up with was a lack of sauce in the bowl compared to other Tikka Masala orders that I've had at other restaurants, but it is only a less-than-minor concern at best. The price was definitely closer to a sit-down restaurant than to a quick-serve joint on the scale of fast-casual restaurants, but I don't think they'll have a problem with justifying the prices as long as they can continue to keep the quality of the food high into their opening and regular business. I'll still be planning to head there again my first day back in the office following their opening on the 28th!---I can't believe there's only two reviews of Mr. Brisket so far...perhaps it's because all of the people who know and love it and come here all the time don't want the secret to spread too far so they can keep the high quality of the store where it's at. Came here on a chilly Saturday because the football games on Sunday required a menu of corned beef. The smallest? 7 lb. for only two of us! No worries, the guy behind the counter said for us to cook it up and then bring in what we didn't eat and they would slice it up nice and thin for us and put it in more manageable portions...for free. Now that's what I call customer service! So far we've only had the brisket, but from their menu, it looks like they've got almost every type of beef you could ever want to cook up, will definitely be coming here for more cuts. We also got a pastrami with stadium mustard and sauerkraut to split for lunch, unbelievably good stuff. The quality of the meat here is second to none. I would love to see these guys do up a food truck in the summertime, they would have lineups down the block for these sandwiches for sure!---Do you like grilled cheese sandwiches? I like grilled cheese sandwiches. If you like grilled cheese as I do, you will really like Melt. Like me. They offer so many different grilled cheese combinations your head will spin. I highly recommend looking at their menu online before going, so you have a clue as to what you might want. I kicked it old school at got a Kindergarten, which is just a plain grilled cheese. Ok a bit boring (esp. compared to the rest of the menu) but I wasn't super hungry, plus I was mid road trip and really didn't need to be in a food coma all the way back home to Chicago. Anyway, I enjoyed my sandwich, but the cheese could have been thismuch more melted. The place is called Melt, right? So hey, let's melt. But this is a minor complaint. These sandwiches are pretty huge...unless you really want to put down some chow, go with the half sandwich. Sandwiches come with some tasty fries, and an optional pickle. Further, if anyone is vegan, they have vegan cheese; if anyone is gluten-free, they offer gluten-free bread. Melt also offers soups, salads, and appetizers. I was quite delighted to see the Burger Time video game in the waiting area. Anyone else remember that? I sucked at it, but if I was 11 and had a quarter, it was surely going in some video game, and Burger Time was in my rotation for sure. Now, if I see the Journey video game the next time I go to Melt, I will bump to 5 stars. And then some.---I had the Wonton soup with BBQ pork & the pork spring rolls. Both items were amazing. The service was quick & effective.---Just fantastic: fresh, simple, inexpensive, and delicious. Great service, menu has photos of everything, very helpful. Thank you!---If I'm going to be on the west side and feel like some Italian, Nino's is now the place I'll be going to. I'm not just saying that because I ordered a whole bottle of wine for myself, I'm honestly not... Their meals were well priced (all you Yelpers saying it should be half off, go buy yourself a Subway sub because I don't know what you're talking about), amply sized, well served and delicious! I ordered the stuffed gnocchi, which came with a salad. The gnocchi was extremely rich and in a creamy blush sauce. Typically I'm happy with a standard old gnocchi and maybe stuffing it was over-doing it, but man...they were delicious little bites of puffiness. The only downfall was that by the time that came, I was already full. The salad we ordered (which we ordered with cheese, a must do!), was HUGE and I cleaned up every last little bit of pasta/lettuce bits. We also ordered a small "old world" style pizza with sausage, and a side cup of provolone. Apparently this is the way to do it, and I whole heartedly agree. So if you're keeping a tally, before my meal I had pizza, a huge salad and I haven't even mentioned the herbed butter bread. So in short, I ate probably two little gnocchi bits before having it boxed to bring home. Good thing I had that whole bottle of wine to wash it down with, huh?---More catching up on reviews, The beer engine is lakewoods orininal gastro pub. As the brewery style restaurants continue to morph to better food and realize it is ok to serve other breweries masterpieces the beer engine has been doing this for years now. I have a property that is close to this place and I find myself coming here more each time I visit it. The beer selection is great and they have sampler selections of just about everything. The food is eclectic bar food centered around the beer. I dont even know if they have wine here and wouldn't even ask because there are so many great beers to discover. The blue cheese tomato soup is superior and unique. The bar chips are great with the sour cream dip they give you. All the sausages have never disappointed. Any sandwich or burger on the pretzel roll will knock you out. Very reasonable prices...beers a re a bit pricey depending on what you order. Service a bit slow..not sure why. Patio is great for people watching.---Who doesn't love Sokolowski's? Realize it's a cafeteria type setting but the food is fantastic.---Great food and service. Busy but not so loud you cannot talk with your friends. Great draft beer and mixed drink menu. A very interesting food menu as well. Everything we had was fresh and well done. Probably one of the best kept secrets in Chagrin Falls. I will definitely be back!---First time ever eating at The Rail. Food was excellent, the waitress was fantastic, and the manager superb. We had one burger that was cooked wrong, it was near raw in the middle. It happens, they took the burger back took it off our bill and gave my wife dessert on top of that. We will return again.---Went there last night with a friend. The service was up to par but the food was out of this world!!! It is the best Italian food I've ever had in a restaurant by far!!!! I got the lasagna (it's pretty hard to beat my family recipe but this rocked!) a side salad (the Italian dressing tasted homemade) and gelato, which melted in my mouth. We also shared a calamari appetizer which was also yummy. The prices were very reasonable and I can't wait to go back!---I am an soulful individual. I appreciate good food and drink. I get excited when local chefs do inspiring things in and out of their kitchen. In his first solo venture, Chef Jonathan Sawyer has outdone himself. If you're a fan of Greenhouse, you know the story: Jonathan Sawyer, Food & Wine's 2010 "Best New Chef", has worked alongside the great Charlie Palmer in NY and Michael Symon here in Cleveland. Chef/Partner of Bar Cento turned restaurateur in his opening of The Greenhouse Tavern; a business based on using local ingredients, sustainable food and environmentally conscious practices. An ambitious project that has seemed to pay off. Cleveland Beer Week and a private 6 course tasting brought me and a couple friends to The Greenhouse for a recent indulgence of bliss and excess. What follows is an account of one of the most enjoyable meals and experiences in public dining that I can think of in recent memory.... The tasting was to take place in the basement. A large square table with 12 seats, 4 on each side was prepared for our arrival. Just past the dining table was the kitchen. It ran like a well oiled machine. If you've ever seen Gordon Ramsay's Hell's Kitchen TV show, this kitchen was nothing like that. There was no screaming or chastising. Instead, the cooks moved in symphony as the chef conducted them. Pushed against the rear wall were shelves stocked with autumn's seasonal bounty of gourds, pumpkins and squash of many varieties, colors and sizes. On the other wall, a vintage jukebox. The exclusivity of our group and the setting were enough to foreshadow the experience that would surely follow. Before each meal, a beer sommelier gave a brief history of each beer we would sample. Next, Johnathan Sawyer himself spoke to us about each dish that was paired with the beer. The same pattern followed throughout the night. What resulted was a memorable night of information, enlightenment, excellent food and exemplary beer. The menu was as follows: First Course paired with a Reissdorf Kolch: Heirloom pork & ricotta meatballs, duck devils on horseback, Ohio black walnut soup & tasty bits. Second Course paired with La Douze: Foie gras tourchon w/ endive apricot chutney Third Course paired with Hitachino White: Beer Vin Mackeral Crudo w/ coriander barley cake Forth Course paired with Taquamari: Duck and Squash Pasta Palatte Cleanse: Red and White Beer Granita Fifth Course paired with Aventinus: Veal w/ cherry sauce & polenta Dessert paired with Sarasola Sagardoa Basque Cider: Apple tart titan w/ salty carmel ice cream In recounting the entire meal, a few standouts were the black walnut soup, the foie gras tourchon and the duck squash pasta. In memory and context alone, this meal stands among a short list of best I've ever had. The food, drink and accompanying knowledge behind it made it even better. Welcome to my Top 3 in the CLE List Greenhouse Tavern. You deserve it!---Agree. Best hibachi in town. Also most expensive but you pay for what you get. Atmosphere is nice- employees are friendly. Sushi is best on this side of town. No just wish they would do something different as far as the hibachi cooks perform- it's always the same routine and gets boring hearing the same thing over and over.---I liked the food here a lot. Its a little different from most Mexican restaurants I've eaten at, not in a bad way though. My girlfriend likes it here which is awesome because she doesn't like any other Mexican restaurant we've been to. But with Zocalo I can be reunited with this wonderful food. The prices here are less than the other places on East 4th.---I love both jack flaps and the jack flaps luncheonette. They take pride in the preparation of their food as well as the presentation. It's a small place so come early or later to get a table.---My family of 4 + a uncle, niece, niece boy friend + 6 more all ate here on a Sunday night around 7 pm. We did have reservations and things were great. All dinners were awesome as always. I ordered my usual- fish and chips. Not the best and not the worse but always consistent. Another thing I usual get is the turkey pot pie. OMG- it's so good. If it's cold out and you need something good - get the turkey pot pie. Great service. Great fun---Johnny Mango is the best! I always get one of two items. The bus boy special is a large plate of grains, beans, and vegetables. All of which I hear are purchased from vendors at the west side market. The vegan nachos are superb. I have tried many vegan cheese options and this is the absolute best substitute to the real thing. Even my fiancé, a meat eater, loves this stuff. Can't go wrong with $4 happy hour margaritas either! Yum!---Awesome food! Definitely come here again. The servers are really friendly, and the Irish theme is pretty cool.---My mother and I just came for their sushi happy hour last night. Luckily it wasn't as crazy crowded as normal (at times it can get jammed in the lounge area since the sushi is good and the prices are great), so the noise level was down, and service was good. We ordered the shrimp tempura, dumplings and seaweed salad to start - all good. Nothing special, but great for the price. I added a bit of hot sauce and soy sauce to the sauces they came with, so all was good. We also ordered a few rolls - spicy tuna, dragon, caterpillar, and shrimp crunchy and they were all nice sized and a great bargain! Everything tasted fresh, although the spicy sauce I asked for wasn't as spicy as I normally like it. The portions were so generous, I had some to take home to the boy (even though they normally don't let you take happy hour home, I think they could tell we weren't trying to scam the place). I still haven't tried Wasabi happy hour, but I am okay with Benihana happy for now!---La shish is our favorite place to eat and we dine out alot! The owner is kind and a great cook. The philly cheesesteak sandwich is the best anywhere and ive traveled all over the U.S. The food is made fresh so be patient. Definitly a must go visit!---Love the Edgar Allen Poe pizza!---Ordered the double burger, which came with about a pound of fresh cut french fries! I really liked the food and the bartender was extremely attentive. Will definitely go back!---Great tacos! It's all a la carte and you can make your own taco if you're a picky eater like me!---Absolutely incredible. For the money, the food was very, very good. Actually great! The staff was very attentive and very friendly. There were five of us there, for the first time, and they treated us like family. We will bring out of the state family to this place. I highly recommend it.---Stopped by on a Friday night around 9pm. Place was pretty full. Cool interior with flat screens showing the Cavs game everywhere. The staff was quick, friendly and attentive. I ordered the Parralax burger which came with a side of fries. Both were delicious and reasonably priced for a gourmet burger. The food came out super fast too. Great place, cool location, great staff. Highly recommend. Looking forward to checking out the original stand by Playhouse Sq in the warmer months.---I love this place. Simple, but good food. The place is not fancy and they don't sell alcohol, but they serve large portions of rich food. Def worth a visit---
