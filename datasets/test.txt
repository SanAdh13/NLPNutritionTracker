Try this place!! We went on a weekday for lunch the day after we got back from a boozy vacay.... needless to say that this was the perfect way to ease back into the real world! The food was amazing and it was so hard to choose from all the options on the menu. I had the Fried Chicken Sausage & my boyfriend had the polish boy, we split the banter disco poutine. Sorry, I ate it so fast that I didn't snap any pics :) Just take my word for it and try it!
I had succotash and natural pizza for breakfast
Liked the variety of toppings, especially the sport peppers and Chicago style relish. The arugula wasn't so fresh but their other toppings such as the lettuce and cucumbers were. I asked for a medium-done burger, although I suppose I should have said medium-rare because the burger was a bit on the well done side. However, I do prefer the simplistic burger style with a bunch of toppings that I cannot always get at other burger joints such as Five Guys. I also prefer these fries over Five Guys since Five Guys fries taste a bit chewy to me (due to their thicker size). The fries are cheaper, making our overall meal slightly under the price we pay at Five Guys. So although the burger itself was decent - the toppings are what may draw you here in general. FYI - no A1, fresh jalapenos (just pickled), or curly fries. And a shout out to the guy who made my burger who didn't shy away from all the toppings I piled on!

We went there with family for a Saturday night dinner. It was extremely crowded which was a good sign of a excellent meal to come. We ordered an appetizer of hummus and also an appetizer of boneless wings with a honey Golden glaze. Both were delicious and very hot in temperature. The waitress recommended some seasonal beers which all were very delightful. It took a while to get the hamburgers but it was well worth the wait. They were stacked high with toppings cooked to perfection and hot to the last bite. We will be back!

We love coming to Momocho!!! Fun margarita flavors, killer guac, and I'm obsessed with the machaca!!! It's making my mouth water just thinking of it!!! I definitely recommend it!! The blood orange margarita is my fav and I prefer the plain ol guac :)) service is good but our server was a lil over zealous and cut my mother in law off a few times while she was asking about the food- take a chill pill dude.
